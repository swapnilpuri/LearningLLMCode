       "As of November 2025, several advanced AI agent frameworks have emerged, enhancing the development and deployment of autonomous systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and supporting complex interactions like multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes LLMs and mathematical frameworks to design adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through combinatorial spaces, supporting scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system introducing a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It incorporates an Experience Pack architecture for structured knowledge retention and continual learning, enhancing adaptability and coordination in complex tasks. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models and introduces novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",

It is notable for understanding and responding in multiple Indian languages. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruti?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Manus**: An autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and autonomous decision-making. Launched in March 2025, Manus is one of the first fully autonomous AI agents designed to execute complex real-world tasks without continuous human supervision.
